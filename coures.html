                The computer business is one of India’s fastest expanding divisions and will remain so for a long time. A diploma in Computer Engineering will help you build a solid foundation in hardware, software, operating systems, computer architecture, electrical engineering and a variety of sub-disciplines and understand its utilisation in different fields. A Diploma in Computer Engineering program covers basic topics like computer programming, operating system, networking, database, etc. After completing the program, you can work as a programmer, system analyst, or cloud architect and maintain computers for other organisations. You can even start your own IT company or work with other organisations

        <h1>DIPLOMA IN CIVIL ENGINEERING</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>We are all fascinated by various tall and unique structures around us, the huge ship docks, tall buildings, and many more. While an architect may only create an aesthetical design of a building, it is the job of a Civil Engineer and their team of assistants to bring that design to life. As you will start by being an assistant, you would be required to conceive the designs, undertake feasibility studies, examine the site and suggest changes in the design. The road to an idea being transformed into reality will be monitored by you. Once the design is ready, you would also be required in managing the project, ensuring that it goes as planned. While it may seem that you are only required in the development phase of a project, it is not true. You would also be required to research extensively about new innovative ways and also be involved in the maintenance of projects, once completed. As India and the world look to boost infrastructure to provide the best possible lifestyle to everyone, jobs in this sector are rising and will remain in demand.</li>

        <h1>DIPLOMA IN ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Electricity at present is not just used for lighting up one’s house. Electricity is now being used in appliances, machinery, and running transport facilities, to name a few. The scope of this program is wide and developing. While through the program you will learn about the conventional engineering methodologies, there will also be emphasis laid on modern technologies to help you receive the best experience possible. With extensive research for the application of electricity in various fields and, also, to find alternatives, more environment-friendly ways to generate electricity are being carried out, having a Diploma in Electrical Engineering will ensure the availability of prospects in multiple fields and in various positions.</li>
